  ## 1. Introduction
  Today, we will be creating the following image reveal effect using Framer Motion and React.
  It's relatively simple to set up and won't take too much time.

  Typically, these sort of effects are created using other animation libraries such as GSAP.
  GSAP is preferable for more complex and flexible animations, but required more manual setup 
  to configure properly, and was a bit awkward to use with React in some use cases.

  In comparison, Framer Motion was built for React, and I personally found that it integrates far easier 
  than other animation libraries while giving us access to powerful effects.

  When trying to learn Framer motion however, I found that there weren't many community resources on 
  recreating popular animation effects, and created this blog in hopes that someone trying to learn Framer Motion
  like I was not long ago will find this useful.

  ## 2. Project Setup
  <br/>

  First, let's create our React app.
  ```
  npx create-react-app image-reveal
  ```
  <br/>
  Next, let's install Framer Motion and import some libraries we will need for the project.
  ```
  npm install framer-motion
  ```
  <br/>
  Then import motion from Framer Motion into your App.js file
  ```
  import { motion } from 'framer-motion';
  ```
</div>
<br/><br/><br/>

<div className='skeleton'>
  ## 3. Creating the HTML/CSS
  Let's start by deleting the default App.js content. 
  Next, let's create write some basic html to hold our image
  <br/>

  ```
  function App() {
    return (
      <main className="container">
        <div className="image">
          <div className="overlay"></div>
          <img src={image}/>
        </div>
      </main>
    );
  }
  ```
  <br/>
  Notice that we've created an empty div element above the image element.
  This div element will act as an overlay that will cover our image with the background color.
  We will then put a x transform animation on the overlay element, creating the image reveal effect.
  Add the following css to get started:

  ```
  $base-color: #e7ddcd;

  .container{
    width: 100vw;
    height: 100vh;
    background-color: $base-color;
    display: flex;
    justify-content: center;
    align-items: center;

    .image{
      width: 40%;
      img{
        width: 100%;
      }
    }
  }
  ```
  <br/>

  .container will hold the parent container width and height, and uses flex to horizontally
  and vertically center the container.
  .image sets the container width of the img element and overlay element, which will be 40% of the view width. 
  We've also added a scss variable to store our background color to use for the overlay.

  Your image element should now be responsive when you resize the window now.
  Below is what the project should look like at this point.

  Next, let's create the overlay effect.

  ```
  .image{
      width: 40%;
      position: relative;
      overflow: hidden;
      .overlay{
        width: 100%;
        height: 100%;
        position: absolute;
        background-color: $base-color;
      }
      img{
        width: 100%;
        height: 100%;
      }
    }

  ```
  <br/>

  Inside .image, we added the .overlay class and set the width and height to 100%, 
  to fit the parent .image container.
  We set position: relative to the parent .image container, and set the .overlay  to position: absolute to position 
  over the container. 

  Now, the overlay should be directly responsive with the image. You're screen should only be displaying 
  your background color at this point.

</div>

  ## 4. Setting up Framer Motion
  Earlier, we installed and imported framer motion into our App.js file. Let's start using it.

  First, Let's convert our overlay and image elements into motion elements. This allows us to apply framer motion animations to 
  their respective elements.

  ```
  <>
    <div className="image">
      <motion.div>
        className="overlay"
      </motion.div> 
      <motion.img>
        src={image}
      </motion.img> 
    </div>
  </>

  ```
  <br/>

  Next, let's add some properties to each element that we'll need to apply the effects.

  ```
  <>
    <div>
      <motion.div>
        className="overlay"
        variants={{
          visible: { 
            opacity: 1, 
            x: "0%", 
          },
          hidden: { 
            opacity: 1, 
            x: "100%", 
            transition: { 
              delay: 0.5, 
              duration: 2, 
              ease: "easeInOut"
            }
          }
        }}
        initial='visible'
        animate='hidden'
      </motion.div> 
      <motion.img>
        src={image}
      </motion.img> 
    </div>
  </>
  ```
  <br/>

  Inside the overlay ```motion.div``` we've declared a set of variants. Variants 
  contain sets of predefined target objects that allow us to orchestrate animations in a declarative way.
  Inside our variant, we've created a ```visible``` object and ```hidden``` object.
  Think of these objects as "start" and "end". It starts with the properties set in visible, and ends with the properties set in hidden.

  In our case, the initial state is set to visible. Our animation is then set to the properties in hidden, which results in a x transformation
  of the overlay by a 100%, which creates the illusion that the image is being revealed.

  Transition properties are also set in an object inside .hidden, which you can customize based on your preferences.

  If you have followed along until here, you should have a simple image reveal effect. Next, we'll add a scaling effect on the image to achieve
  a more natural and smooth look to the overall animation.

  Next, let's change up the img element and apply Framer Motion to it. Change the img element to the following code

  ```
  <>
    <motion.img 
      src={image}
      variants={{
        visible: {
          scale: 1.3
        },
        hidden: {
          scale: 1,
          transition: {
            delay: 0.5, 
            duration: 3, 
            ease: "easeInOut"
          }
        }
      }}
      initial='visible'
      animate='hidden'
    />
  </>
  ```
  <br/>

  Above, we applied properties similar to the overlay, but here we apply a scale transformation rather than an x transformation.
  Here is the full App.js code

  ```
  import image from './assets/image.jpg';
  import { motion } from 'framer-motion';
  import './App.scss';

  function App() {
    return (
      <main className="container">
        <div className="image">
          <motion.div 
            className="overlay"
            variants={{
              visible: { 
                opacity: 1, 
                x: "0%", 
              },
              hidden: { 
                opacity: 1, 
                x: "100%", 
                transition: { 
                  delay: 0.5, 
                  duration: 2, 
                  ease: "easeInOut"
                }
              }
            }}
            initial = 'visible'
            animate = 'hidden'
            >
          </motion.div>
          <motion.img 
            src={image}
            variants={{
              visible: {
                scale: 1.3
              },
              hidden: {
                scale: 1,
                transition: {
                  delay: 0.5, 
                  duration: 3, 
                  ease: "easeInOut"
                }
              }
            }}
            initial='visible'
            animate='hidden'
          />
        </div>
      </main>
    );
  }

  export default App;

  ```
  <br/>

  And here is the full scss code

  ```
  $base-color: #e7ddcd;

  .container{
    width: 100vw;
    height: 100vh;
    background-color: $base-color;
    display: flex;
    justify-content: center;
    align-items: center;
    .image{
      width: 40%;
      position: relative;
      overflow: hidden;
      .overlay{
        height: 100%;
        position: absolute;
        width: 100%;
        background-color: $base-color;
        z-index: 1;
      }
      img{
        width: 100%;
        height: 100%;
      }
    }
  }
  ```
  <br/>

  And there you have it! You should now have the image reveal effect up and working, like below.
